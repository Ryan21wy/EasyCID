	* Import: This operation will create a table of database and then the spectra can be imported from the select folder into Components Window of Main Window.

	* Open: import the Raman spectra of unknown mixtures into Unknown Window of **Main Window**.

	* Save As: save the current forecast results as an EXCEL file.
	* link to database: link to an established database. Note that, only databases created through EasyCID can be successfully connected.
	* set up new database: create a database for storing and managing Raman spectral information.

Toobar is used to perform some specific functions of EasyCID, which includes **Clear plot area**, **Multiple plots**, **Train CNN models**, **Prediction**, **Quantitative analysis**. Here is a brief introduction:

	* Clear plot area: click to clear all spectra plotted in the **component plot area**.
	* Multiple plot: click to keep the previously drawn spectra when drawing a new spectrum in the **component plot area**, and click again to return to the normal drawing state.
	* Train CNN models: click to pop up the **Parameters Setting Window** as the start of the training process.
	* Prediction: click to predict pure components of each selected unknown mixtures. 
	* Quantitative analysis: click to pop up the **Quantitative Analysis Window** as the start of the quantitative Analysis process.

Context Menu

Context menu is available in EasyCID as a right-click menu of **Components** in the Data information area. It is used to manage tables and spectra in the database, which includes *Delete Table*, *Change Table Name*, *Add Spectra*, *Delete Spectra*. Here is a brief introduction:

	* Delete Table: click to delete the selected table and all spectral information in it.
	* Change Table Name: click to change the name of the selected table in the pop-up window.
	* Link Modelsï¼šclick to load the local models.
	* Add Spectra: click to import the spectra from the specified folder into the selected table.
